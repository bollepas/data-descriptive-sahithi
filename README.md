## Project Description
Descriptive Analysis of the City of Vancouverâ€™s Multi-Year Capital Project Budget Data

## Project Title
Analyzing Customer Purchase Patterns at XYZ Retail

## Objective
The goal of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of Vancouver's multi-year capital project data. This analysis aims to summarize key trends and insights in budget allocation and expenditures to inform stakeholders and support decision-making processes.

## Dataset
The data includes:
- Multi-year capital project budgets for 2025
- Historical expenditure data
- Service categories such as "Public Safety," "Streets," and "Parks and Open Spaces"
- Additional metadata detailing project names and budgetary variances

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection
- The dataset was sourced from the City of Vancouver open data portal.
- Filters were applied to extract relevant service categories and budget-related data.
- The filtered data was staged and stored in AWS S3 buckets (`ceb-raw-sah`).

### 2. Data Profiling and Cleaning
- AWS Glue DataBrew was used for profiling and cleaning.
  - Missing values were identified and imputed appropriately.
  - Outliers were addressed to maintain dataset integrity.
  - Duplicates were removed for streamlined analysis.
- A standardized schema was implemented to align data formats across all fields.

### 3. Data Analysis
#### Descriptive Statistics
- Summary metrics were calculated, including:
  - Total budget allocations per service category
  - Average expenditures over the past years
  - Variances between proposed budgets and historical spending

#### Visualizations
- Bar charts and pie charts were created to visualize:
  - Budget distribution across service categories
  - Year-on-year expenditure trends
  - Percentage share of total budget by service category
